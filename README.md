# ULTRA software suite
Suite of codes and libraries at the basis of RHEA. ULTRA is a collection of tools for robust multi-disciplinary conceptual and preliminary deisgn and optimisation of ultra-high aspect ratio wing and the associated airframe. Namley it contains:

1. FEMWET - Adjoint-based aerostructual conceptual design
2. GEMS - Multi-level optimisation framework
3. MODES - Adaptive Reduced Order algorithms for aerodynamics
4. SHARPY - Nonlinear simulation and analysis package for the structural, aerodynamic, and coupled aeroelastic/flight dynamics analysis
5. SUAVE - Conceptual level aircraft design environment
6. SMART-MATH - Mathematical toolbox
7. SMART-O2C - Toolbox with optimisation algorithms
8. SMART-UQ - Uncertainty quantification toolbox

Other external tools that are used and not modified within RHEA are: SU2 (https://github.com/su2code/SU2), gmsh (https://gmsh.info).

NOTE: Please ensure you are checking out the feature-RHEA branch for the various libraries to ensure consistency and compatibiity of tools.
